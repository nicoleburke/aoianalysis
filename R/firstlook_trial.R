###### The function! ######
### currently IN PROGRESS

## Anything in the function that is commented out
##    that says "print(___) is just so I could check the function

## The function does not like NAs for the boolean evaluators
##    See 'getridofNA' function

# Input needs to be: dataframe, "columnheads"

# trying to add a layer to go through trial as well as subjects
